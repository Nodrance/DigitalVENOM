A competitive 2D fighter created in python.
This game was designed for Me (Owen) and my brother (Eden) to play as a competitive 2D fighter, because we were getting tire of having to make rules and exceptions and having to ban characters and stages. So I designed this game to allow us to balance it ourselves so if we ever thought the game was unbalanced, we could fix it ourselves.
This game was created entirely (so far) by Me (Owen). Though it is noteworthy that my brother Eden may work on this in the future.
I personally created all of the sprites, music, sound effects, GUI, backgrounds, code, and everything else for this game myself.
I hope others outside of me friends and family may also find joy playing this game, and if anyone wants to suggest any changes, or submit bug reports, be my guest. I will try to listen to any feedback presented by others.
